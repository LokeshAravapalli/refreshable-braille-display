## Introduction
Welcome to our Refreshable Braille Display Project! This repository contains the code and hardware designs for our project, which was created during the ELCIA hackathon from 24-06-2024 to 16-07-2024.

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a refreshable braille display to assist visually impaired individuals. The display will convert digital/printed text into braille in real-time, enabling users to read digital/printed content through the braille display.
